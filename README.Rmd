The goal of `epicdata` is to summarize data processing in a central package and deliver clean data for epidemiology. Metadata is specified as YAML in a format developed to be as user-friendly and comprehensive as possible. Based on the metadata, `epicdata` will create an R project with all code for data processing. The `epicdata` workflow has been influenced by the concept of data quality in observational health data of R package [dataquieR](https://dataquality.qihs.uni-greifswald.de/IntroductoryTutorial.html). However, while `dataquieR` focuses on quality reporting, this package focuses on data processing.

**`epicdata` is currently under construction**

## Installation

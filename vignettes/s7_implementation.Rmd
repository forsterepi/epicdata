## Class

If `NULL` is a valid value for a certain property, `NULL` needs to be added to the class, i.e., the property's class needs to be a union of the correct base type, e.g., character, and `NULL`. If `NULL` needs to be defined as the default value, argument `default` in the property function cannot be used. Instead, `NULL` needs to be named first in the specification of the union in argument `class` of the property function.

``` r
class = NULL | S7::class_character
```

If there is a setter function that transforms the input from one type to another, e.g., from a character vector to a data.frame, the class needs to fit to the type of the object that is returned by the setter, i.e., class is checked after the setter.

## Length

Length of an input is checked in the validator of the property function.

``` r
validator = function(value) {
    if (!(is.null(value) | length(value) == 1L)) {
      "must have length 1"
    }
  }
```

If a property has a complex setter function, length is checked in this setter function.

## Options

There are three types of options:

-   Study information, i.e., information on the study-level
-   Workflow module selection, which is necessary if modules cannot be selected based on other information alone
-   Global variable defaults, i.e., the 3rd layer of the default cascade

Note that there is no formal definition of the option type. The definition is indirect by what they do in the code.

Option types "study information" and "workflow module selection" are implemented as individual properties of class metadata.

## Defaults

### Options of type "study information" and "workflow module selection"

Their default is defined in the setter of the corresponding property function in class metadata. The basic structure of the setter is:

``` r
  setter = function(self, value) {
    if (is.null(value)) {
      self@example.option <- "example.default.value"
    } else {
      self@example.option <- value
    }
    self
  }
```

If the option has no default, no additional code is necessary, because extracting a non-existing element from a list returns value `NULL`, which is the intended value.

## Workflow

Every module and sub-module of the workflow has a corresponding property in class metadata. These properties are read-only. This is implemented by using property functions that only contain a getter, which results in `TRUE` or `FALSE` based on other properties. See the example for sub-module `DUP_FREQ` below. Note that class has not been specified.

``` r
meta.prop.DUP_FREQ <- S7::new_property(
  getter = function(self) {
    if (is.null(self@id.var)) {
      FALSE
    } else {
      TRUE
    }
  }
)
```
